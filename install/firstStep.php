    <p>Hello, let's start now with small steps to set up your new website.</p>
    <p>We will start with a very important point. Let's configure some items for the correct functioning of the CMS</p>
    <p>In this step we will need:</p>
    <p>- Database name</p>
    <p>- Database server user name</p>
    <p>- Database server password</p>
    <p>- Database server</p>
    <p>This information is important and essential for the proper functioning of the system. These settings are available
        on 'databaseConnection.php' file that is inside the 'connections' folder. If you want to change them in the future, just edit
        this file with the new configuration.
    </p>

    <p>If you do not know this data, before doing so, seek guidance from your hosting server so that they can assist you.</p>
